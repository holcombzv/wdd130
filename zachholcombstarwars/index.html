                I have been reading Star Wars books for most of the last decade, so a lot of my friends have come to see me as a bit of a Star Wars guru. I enjoy both Legends and Canon books and am familiar with both timelines. Many people have asked me for suggestions for which books to start with or what to read next. These timelines and reviews should help people get the information they want from me without a several hours-long explanation about the entirety of Star Wars.
