      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Context/Home Page: I have been reading Star Wars books for most of the last decade, so a lot of my friends have come to see me as a bit of a Star Wars guru. I enjoy both Legends and Canon books and am familiar with both timelines. Many people have asked me for suggestions for which books to start with or what to read next. These timelines and reviews should help people get the information they want from me without a several hours-long explanation about the entirety of Star Wars. The main page will not contain any sort of “about me” section outside of the context of being a Star Wars nerd since the only people that would be visiting this site would be people that I have met before and that have asked me questions.
